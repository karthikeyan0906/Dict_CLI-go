# Dict_CLI-go

This is a simple CLI dictionary tool written in Go that fetches word definitions from a free dictionary API. It processes a single word entered by the user and prints its definition, part of speech, and pronunciation.

Below packages are used 

net/http - for making API requests
encoding/json - parsing unstructured json 
os.Args - to work with CLI args passed by user
io - to read response body

Output

    pen (noun): An enclosure (enclosed area) used to contain domesticated animals, especially sheep or cattle.
    Pronunciation: /p…õn/
if the word doesn't exist it will return "No definitions found"
